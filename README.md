Hello everyone, I'm Shivani a data scientist. This repository contains my project on analyzing road accidents across 50 major cities in India for the year 2020, using data exploration and visualization techniques to uncover key insights and trends.
**Dataset:**
   Source: data.gov.in  
   Year: 2020 
   Number of Cities: 50
**Features:**
  Million Plus Cities: Names of the cities
  Cause Category: 5 primary categories (Traffic Control, Junction, Road Features, Impacting Vehicle/Object, Weather Conditions)
  Cause Subcategory: Detailed cause of accidents
  Outcome of Incident: Injuries, deaths, and total accidents
  Count: Number of incidents in millions
**Methodology:**
  1.Importing Libraries and Loading Data
  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Analyzing accident trends across cities
    Visualizing cause categories and subcategories
    Investigating accident outcomes (injuries, deaths, accidents)
3.Data Cleaning:
    Handling missing values
    Addressing any outliers
4.Insights:
   Identified the major causes of accidents in different cities
   Examined the relationship between weather conditions and accident outcomes
   Analyzed patterns in accident outcomes (injuries and deaths) based on the cause categories.
**Libraries Used:**
    Pandas
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
